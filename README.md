# DrinkCounter_Apple_Watch
Relax, we'll count your drinks, you enjoy your moment.


The "home screen": [ContentView.swift](https://github.com/mrvivacious/DrinkCounter_Apple_Watch/blob/main/Drink%20Counter%20WatchKit%20Extension/ContentView.swift)

The "drink counter": [DrinkCounterView.swift](https://github.com/mrvivacious/DrinkCounter_Apple_Watch/blob/main/Drink%20Counter%20WatchKit%20Extension/DrinkCounterView.swift)

Feel free to suggest improvements to the code design and whatnot

Enjoy


### todo

Add a demo (video / gif) to the readme

Add "Drink Counter" label in top left of app so it looks more like an Apple in-house app? is possible?

Publish this to the store, share on fb / product hunt (but this isnt a product?? is free) / reddit (swift, ios, learn programming, etc) / hacker news? idk

? Refactor code? This would require me to learn more about Swift LOL not a bad deal

Button to text a friend r smtH, request uber? not v1 feature though

## Roadmap

v1.0

User can set any number of drink limit

Published to store

No companion iOS app (hmmmm....)

v2.0

Option to notify a friend when limit is reached

Second screen to show times when each drink was taken

iWatch home screen widget

No companion iOS app (hmmmm....)
